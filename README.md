# Fast and flexible range-separated models for atomistic machine learning - Auxiliary Code Repository

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2412.03281-B31B1B.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03281)

This repository includes additional codes and input files used for the work "Fast and
flexible range-separated models for atomistic machine learning" available at
https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03281.

Each directory contains files for a different part of the publication with their own
`README` explaining the requirements and usage.

Additional examples for [learning
charges](https://lab-cosmo.github.io/torch-pme/latest/examples/5-autograd-demo.html) and
[Fourier-space
kernels](https://lab-cosmo.github.io/torch-pme/latest/examples/8-combined-potential.html)
shown in Figure 6 and a tutorial to construct [LODE
densities](https://lab-cosmo.github.io/torch-pme/latest/examples/7-lode-demo.html) are
direct available inside the torch-pme [documentation](https://lab-cosmo.github.io/torch-pme).

For a general usage of [torch-pme](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/torch-pme) and
[jax-pme](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/jax-pme) refer to their repositories and
documentation directly.
