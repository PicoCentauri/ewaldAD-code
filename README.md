# Fast and flexible range-separated models for atomistic machine learning - Auxiliary Code Repository

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-XXX.XXX-B31B1B.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/XXX.XXXX)

The repository includes additional codes and input files used for the work "Fast and flexible
range-separated models for atomistic machine learning" available at
https://arxiv.org/abs/XXX.XXXX.

Each directory contains file for a different part of the publication each with their own
README explaining the requirements and usage.

Additional examples for [learning charges](XX) and [Fourierspace kernels](XXX) shown in
Figure 6 and a tutorial to construct [LODE densities](XXX) are direct available inside
the torch-pme documentation.

For a general usage of [torch-pme](XXX) and [jax-pme](XXX) refer to their repositories
and documentation directly.
