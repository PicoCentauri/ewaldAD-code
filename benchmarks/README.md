# Benchmarks

This folder contains the `torch-pme` and `jax-pme` benchmarks reported in the manuscript. More detailed information can be found in the respective subfolders. All benchmarks were performed on a single node on the `kuma` cluster at EPFL, using a H100.

Both folders expect a `crystals.xyz` file with the input structures. This file is provided here in zipped form, and needs to be decompressed and copied into the respective folders before use.
